This project explores how energy is distributed and electricity is generated in selected European countries. Using comprehensive data analysis methodologies, The aims was assess the efficiency and sustainability of energy distribution systems, considering the technology used and explicitly addressing the environmental impact of electricity generation. By examining key metrics, such as gigawatt-hour (GWH) production, My goal is to provide insights into the current state of energy infrastructure. The findings will assist in optimizing energy use and guiding future policies for cleaner and more effective energy distribution.
